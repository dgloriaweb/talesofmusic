I have been listening to the audiobook "The Gospel According To Luke." on Spotify (which I am a premium member, but the minutes I can listen to audiobooks are limited), he talks about the death of Jeff Porcaro. He speaks about how shocking his sudden death was and the tribute concert they did with names like Eddie Van Halen, Don Henley, Simon Philips, and George Harrison alongside the members of Toto and Mike and Steve Porcaro. I have found a video with audio only, but it's kinda good. [Toto | The Jeff Porcaro Tribute Concert - Live at the Universal Amphitheater, Los Angeles, CA - 1992](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFL4sdXg_AU) The complete list can be found in the video description alongside the discord of Toto.
